## Introduction
Depression is a widespread mental health condition with debilitating symptoms affecting millions globally. This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to identify depressive signals from textual data on platforms like Reddit. The study emphasizes the importance of early detection and the role of linguistic analysis tools.

## Existing Work
Previous research has delved into sentiment analysis and machine learning models to identify mental health concerns in online text. However, challenges in accuracy, specificity, and ethical considerations have been recognized. This project builds upon these foundations, aiming to enhance the understanding of mental health indicators in digital communication.

## Research Gap
Notable research gaps include the need for fine-grained, interpretable models, studies on the effectiveness of mental health interventions on social media, and ethical considerations in automated mental health screening. Closing these gaps is essential for advancing mental health detection on social media responsibly.

## Methodology
Data from diverse online sources underwent meticulous preprocessing, including LIWC analysis and TF-IDF vectorization. MLP and SVM classifiers were employed, with SVM demonstrating superior accuracy (94.8%). The methodology combined linguistic analysis with conventional NLP and machine learning techniques.

## Conclusion and Future Work
Both MLP and SVM classifiers showed strong performance in detecting depression-related content. The study highlights the potential of integrating linguistic analysis with NLP and machine learning for early depression detection. Future work can explore different n-gram ranges, consider recurrent neural networks (RNNs), fine-tune LIWC categories, address class imbalance, and enhance interpretability through techniques like LIME and SHAP.

This project contributes to ongoing efforts in mental health awareness and emphasizes the benefits of leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques for identifying and treating mental health problems in the digital era.
